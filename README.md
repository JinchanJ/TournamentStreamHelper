# Getting started

## I'm streaming online tournaments (not playing)

- Click on the SmashGG button's arrow, configure your SmashGG Key as prompted (only needs to be done once)
- Click again on the SmashGG button's arrow, configure the tournament link as prompted
- Now clicking the SmashGG button will open a list of matches for you to pick from. Pick a set
- Auto update should start -- it will update all data in the program and also the files in /out/. It also updates selected characters and the stage striking sequence

- If you're configuring the StreamQueue in SmashGG, there is an auto mode in the Twitch button, which will also get the next set automatically. Use this for full automation.

- Remember to turn on autosave on the save button's arrow if you want it
- Notice that the auto-update will overwrite your edits, so cancel it if you want to edit data manually

## I'm streaming my own run in an online tournament

- Activate **Settings** > **Competitor Mode**

- Click on the SmashGG button's arrow, configure your SmashGG Key as prompted (only needs to be done once)
- Click on the SmashGG button's arrow, configure your SmashGG user id as prompted (only needs to be done once)

- You'll be always the player on the left, and all match data will be updated automatically
- When a new set starts, the data will automatically update

- Remember to turn on autosave on the save button's arrow if you want it
- Notice that the auto-update will overwrite your edits, so cancel it if you want to edit data manually

## I'm streaming an offline tournament

- You can download autocomplete data from either SmashGG (using a tournament link) or PowerRankings.gg
- When you start entering a name, autocomplete should show options that will auto-fill player's data

- Remember to turn on autosave on the save button's arrow if you want it

# Usage with OBS

## Sample overlays

There are sample overlays located in the `/layout/` directory. In OBS, add a Browser element, select local file, then select one of the `.html` in the subdirectories.

- Make sure to set the window size to 1920x1080 for the overlay samples.
- Make sure to set the browser element to hide when inactive and reload on scene change, or else you will get a quick flicker when the scene is changed.
- For the stage striking sample, experiment with different window sizes as the elements will adapt to it (i.e. 2000x2000, 1000x1000, 500x500, ...)
- For the VS screen, please check out `index.js` to select which asset pack you want to use

There's also instructions for editing those layouts in the `/layout/` directory.

## Using OBS Elements

When you click save (or edit anything when auto save is on) a directory named `out` is created in the program's directory, containing the players' data. In OBS, when you create a `Text` element, in its `properties`, there is an option to load the text from a text file. Redirect Text elements to the text files and the images from `out` to have your overlay synced with the program's output.

It's not possible to animate these elements unless there's an OBS plugin for that (I'm not aware of one).

### Tips
- In OBS you can select any element and use `Edit > Transform > Edit Transform (Ctrl+E)`. There you can set up the absolute position and size for your elements. There are alignment options and bounding box options so that when a player's name would overflow your layout the font gets smaller instead. Also works for images, where you can reserve a space and the image will fit that space independent of image size or proportion

# Extra configs

## Sponsor logos

You can find a directory called `/sponsor_logos/` in the program's directory. If you put an image, say, `google.png` (has to be a lowercase png), and a player has its prefix set as `GOOGLE`, `google` (or any casing variations) this file will also get copied to the output.
